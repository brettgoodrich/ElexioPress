## Usage

#### WordPress backend
ElexioPress' settings are given their own page parented to "Settings". You can easily edit key information.

You can access the plugin's settings with `elexiopress()`, which will `return` an array like so:
```
Array
(
    [elexiopress_keys_activationkey] => the activation key
    [elexiopress_keys_apipass] => the apipass
)
```
